This is my first blog on this site. I have been long think about building a
personal  website to display and record who I am and what I have been working
on. 

I tried to use Rmarkdown with Rstudio to build my web. Rmarkdown is a nice
tool and it is very easy to use. With Rstudio you can easily incorporate R code
in your pages and there some nice themes you can use to briefly decorate your
person pages. But the disadvange of that is lack of certain flexibility and at
the same time I don't want to spend a lot of time studying the detail of html,
css and bootstrap. Lately I got to know Jekyll which ia officially supported by
Github page. I found the tradeoff between flexibility (using html and css) and
easy usage (using template and markdown language) is what I want. And Jekyll has
a very nice and easy way to organize your blog posts.

As I mentioned, the goal of this site is to present what I have been working
on. And I will also gradually upload some posts that summary some of my notes
during study of softwares, data science and machine learning. Currently, I write
org mode in Emacs and seperate notes to help my to keep tracks of those things
that I learned. I've been seeking a way to put them together, so that it will be
easier for me to find in the future. And also hope those notes will help people
with a similar background like me. 

Finally, let's enjoy bolgging and again hello to all.
