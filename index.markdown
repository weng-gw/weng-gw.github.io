# About me
![wgw](/assets/images/portrait.jpg)

Welcome to my home page!

I am a PhD candidate at [School of Statistics, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics).

I am working with Professor [Charles Doss](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~cdoss/) on research problems related to nonparametric function estimation, causal inference and data visualization.

Besides my research, I'm also a passionate learner and practioner of machine learning.

In Fall 2019, I am teaching STAT 3701 Introduction to Statistical Computing.
